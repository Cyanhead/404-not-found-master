<!-- Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :) -->

I created a responsive error 404 page following a design from <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">Devchallenges.io</a>.
You can find links to the demo, as well as the code at the top.

### Built With

I built this with only

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) -->

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories. It is a static page and does not do anything.

## Acknowledgements

The responsiveness of the page is achieved using "display: flex;". Oh how i love flex ðŸ˜„.

<!-- This section should list any articles or add-ons/plugins that helps you to complete the project. This is optional but it will help you in the future. For exmpale -->
