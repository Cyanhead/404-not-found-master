<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Cyanhead/404-not-found-master/blob/master/Screenshot.png)

I created a responsive error 404 page following a design from <a href="http://devchallenges.io" target="_blank">Devchallenges.io</a>.
You can find links to the demo, as well as to the code, at the top.
If you are just starting out, it is something you too can do üëçüèΩ.

### Built With

I built this with only

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories. It is a static page and does not do anything.

## Acknowledgements

The responsiveness of the page is achieved using ["display: flex;"](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp). Oh how i love flex üòÑ.
